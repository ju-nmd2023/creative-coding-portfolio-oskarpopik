    "description": "Starting from a course example of a grid, I modified the structure into 2x3 cells resembling a Braille cell. Instead of abstract patterns, dots are randomly placed in these positions, creating the impression of Braille-like characters. This simple change transformed the grid into something more symbolic and language-like."
